# Concepts:
- Function overloading (Ad-hoc polymorphism)
- Operator overloading
- Orthodox Canonical form
- Fixed-point numbers

Implemented a `Fixed` class in Orthodox Canonical Form with raw bit storage and accessor methods, practicing constructors, destructors, copy semantics, and encapsulation.

Usage:
```
make
```
```
./fixed
```
