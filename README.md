# C++ Module 02
# Concepts:
- Function overloading (Ad-hoc polymorphism)
- Operator overloading
- Orthodox Canonical form
- Fixed-point numbers

# ex00

Implemented a `Fixed` class in Orthodox Canonical Form with raw bit storage and accessor methods, practicing constructors, destructors, copy semantics, and encapsulation.

Usage:
```
make
```
```
./fixed
```

# ex01

Extended the `Fixed` class with `int` and `float` constructors, conversion methods (`toInt`, `toFloat`), and stream output overloading to represent fixed-point numbers more meaningfully.`

Usage:
```
make
```
```
./fixed
```

# ex02

Enhanced the `Fixed` class with overloaded comparison, arithmetic, and increment/decrement operators, plus static `min`/`max` functions, enabling natural mathematical operations between fixed-point objects.

Usage:
```
make
```
```
./fixed
```
